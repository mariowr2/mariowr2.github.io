FIRA (Federation of International Robot-soccer Association) 2018 has concluded and I am very happy to have participated! Participating in this competition was an incredibly challenging situation, as well as a very rewarding one. Robotics competitions are like hackathons, except they go on for 5 days :) .The Snobots Adult team earned the following trophies:  

* 1st place in Moving Archery event
* 1st place in Triple Jump event
* 3rd place in Basketball event

This was my favorite moment in the competition:
